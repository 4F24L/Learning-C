// Chef and Brain Speed
// In ChefLand, human brain speed is measured in bits per second (bps). Chef has a threshold limit of X bits per second above which his calculations are prone to errors. If Chef is currently working at Y bits per second, is he prone to errors?

// If Chef is prone to errors print YES, otherwise print NO.
